This is an Agent Based Framework which demonstrates NanoVC as a great data structure at the core of an agent based framework.
The repo allows us to model alternate futures/solutions as well as making each agent think that it's the first to process at each iteration.
We then merge each agent's changes and spawn parallel solutions if there is a conflict.
